# From Notebook Experiments to Modular Coding:
Here we will first run our experiments like checking the functions, modules and processes are correct or not. If it is correct working fine then we shift to modular coding. Here are the process follows:

> `Create Functions(OOP) in notebooks(dir = research)` --> `Modular Coding`.

## Notebook Experiments:
1. Go to the working directory.
2. Define `Entity`
3. Define the `Configuration Manager`
4. Create `Components`
5. Define the pipeline.
6. Run the pipeline.

## Modular Coding:
After finishing the experiments. Now it's time for modular coding:
1. Go to entity dir. (Update the `config_entity.py`)
2. Go to the config dir. (Update the `configuration.py`)
3. Go to the components dir. (Create a new `component_name.py` file)
4. Go to the pipeline dir. (Create a new `stage_num.py` file)
5. Update the `main.py` file which is the **endpoint** of the project.
